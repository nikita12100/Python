## Model of solar system.

Using `Box2D` which is based on `pygame`.

```
$ pip install Box2D pygame
```

There is 3 planets and the sun.

How we can see, after some time mediun planet became satellite of big planet. And another 
medium planet want to go out of solay system.

I udes just Box2D methods and school Newton formula: `F = G(m_1*m_2)/r^2`.
